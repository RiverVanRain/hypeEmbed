## Features

* Search, upload and embed files on the spot
* Search and embed all other registered object types on the spot
* ECML-ready
* Resolve and embed remote URLs using Iframely


## Notes

* For best results, install hypeScraper and ECML
https://github.com/hypeJunction/hypeScraper
https://github.com/Elgg/ecml

* If you do not have ECML or hypeScraper enabled, you can use the URL embeds with JQuery Media Embedding -

## Using Elgg Customizable Markup Language (ECML)

### Attributes

By default, the following attributes are allowed for the ECML 'embed' keyword.
You can extend the list of allowed attributes via ```'ecml:attributes:entity', 'embed'``` hook.

* ```guid``` guid of an entity
* ```list_type``` list type, e.g. list or gallery
* ```full_view``` entity listing to show
* ```size``` icon size
* ```context``` a comma separated list of contexts to push into the context stack
				by default, the entity views will be in embed and widgets contexts

Alternative use of the ECML 'embed' keyword allows the standalone ```src``` attribute.
You can extend the list of allowed attributes via ```'ecml:attributes:src', 'embed'``` hook.

Example ECML embed string:

```
[embed guid="555" list_type="gallery" full_view="true" size="large" context="activity,search"]
[embed src="http://youtube.com/893dkeie9"]
```


### Views

You can add custom views to ```embed/ecml/$type/$subtype```.
See ```embed/ecml/object/file``` for an example.


## Developer Notes

* Use ```output/embed``` view to output an embedded URL:

```
echo elgg_view('output/embed', array(
	'value' => 'https://github.com/Elgg/Elgg'
));
```

## Installing with Composer

hypeEmbed can be included in your Elgg project by require from the project's
root composer.json.

Support for composer in Elgg is an experimental feature pioneered by [@Srokap](https://github.com/Srokap/ "Pawe≈Ç Sroka").

Provisional config to include hypeEmbed into your project:
```json
{
	"minimum-stability": "dev",
